- Not all timers are available on all STM32F4xx devices
- Not all timers works with same tick frequency
- All timers have **16bit** prescaler
- **TIM6** and **TIM7** donâ€™t have PWM feature, they are only basic timers
- **TIM2** and **TIM5** are 32bit timers
- **TIM9** and **TIM12** have two PWM channels
- **TIM10**, **TIM11**, **TIM13** and **TIM14** have only one PWM channel
- All channels at one timer have the same PWM frequency!
